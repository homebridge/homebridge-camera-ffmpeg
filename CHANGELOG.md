**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.1.2...v3.1.3

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.1.2) (2021-03-05)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.1.1...v3.1.2

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.1.1) (2021-03-01)

### What's Changes
- Snapshots are now briefly cached. This will prevent bombarding the camera with requests for new snapshots when motion alerts are triggered.
- Improved messaging when cameras respond slowly.
- Minor tweaks.
- Updated dependencies.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.1.0...v3.1.1

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.1.0) (2021-02-20)

### What's Changes
#### Breaking Changes
- Complete rework of MQTT support. Now topics and messages are configurable per camera, which should allow any camera with MQTT support to work directly with this plugin. If you need compatibility with the way prior versions worked, you can follow [this config example](https://sunoo.github.io/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/automation/mqtt.html#legacy-compatibility).
- Dropped support for older versions of Homebridge, now requires version 1.1.3 or newer.

#### Other Changes
- *Fix*: Fixed warnings under Homebridge 1.3 when using switches.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.6...v3.1.0

## [3.0.6](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.6) (2021-02-17)

### What's Changes
- Added `motionDoorbell` to ring the doorbell when motion is activated in order to allow motion alerts to be displayed on Apple TVs.
- HTTP server now returns JSON to provide additional information to helper plugins.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.5...v3.0.6

## [3.0.5](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.5) (2021-02-15)

### What's Changes
- Code cleanup and general housekeeping.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.4...v3.0.5

## [3.0.4](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.4) (2021-02-15)

### What's Changes
- Added warning when attempting to use videoFilter with the copy vcodec.
- Added support for connecting to an MQTT broker with TLS.
- Updated dependencies.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.3...v3.0.4

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.3) (2020-09-02)

### What's Changes
- Updated dependencies.

### Note
- Homebridge 1.1.3 is now out. It is highly recommended to upgrade as it should completely resolve the issue that caused live video not to work while snapshots continued to update. Once you upgrade, `interfaceName` will no longer have any impact. At some point in the future this plugin will drop support for Homebridge 1.1.2 and lower and also remove the `interfaceName` option.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.2...v3.0.3

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.2) (2020-08-30)

### What's Changes
- Allow `=` in the URL for HTTP automation for systems that require it. Everything after the `=` will be ignored.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.1...v3.0.2

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.1) (2020-08-25)

### What's Changes
- *Fix*: Fixed an issue with inactive camera timeouts that could cause zombie FFmpeg processes.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v3.0.0...v3.0.1

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v3.0.0) (2020-08-24)

### What's Changes
### Breaking Changes
- `additionalCommandline` has been replaced by `encoderOptions` to better reflect it's intended use.
- `preserveRatio` has been removed and is now active as long as the default `videoFilter` list is active.

#### Other Changes
- This plugin now includes __experimental__ two-way audio support. Be aware that this feature is likely to be tweaked in the future, and a configuration that works now may need to be altered in the future.
- Better detection of audio and video streams. There should be very few scenarios where `mapvideo` or `mapaudio` are needed anymore, as FFmpeg's stream auto-selection is now set up.
- Default `videoFilter` can be disabled by including `none` in your comma-delimited list of filters.
- Further reorganization of the config UI.
- Fix: Corrected handling of inactive camera timeouts. You should no longer see timeout messages after cleanly closing a camera stream.
- *Fix*: Fixed `forceMax` not applying to resolution in some scenarios.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v2.5.0...v3.0.0

## [2.5.0](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v2.5.0) (2020-08-23)

### What's Changes
### Breaking Changes
- Horizontal and vertical flip have been removed. If you need these options, pass `hflip` and/or `vflip` in `videoFilter`.
- `forceMax` has resulted in the removal of `minBitrate`, as it is now redundant. To replicate the old behavior, set `maxBitrate` to the bitrate you want to use and set `forceMax` to true.
- `preserveRatio` is now a boolean to reduce confusion and support the better handling of that option.

- ### Other Changes
- `forceMax` has been added. This will force the use of `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, `maxFPS`, and `maxBitrate` when set.
- If `maxWidth`, `maxHeight`, or `maxFPS` are set to `0`, the width, height, or framerate of the source will now be used for the output.
- If `maxBitrate` is set to `0`, the bitrate of the encoder will not be limited. I strongly recommend against this, but it is a better option than setting it to `999999` or similar values, as I've seen in some configs.
- Reorganized config UI options.
- *Fix:* Fix handling of IPv6 connections.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v2.4.7...v2.5.0

## [2.4.7](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v2.4.7) (2020-08-17)

### What's Changes
- Changed the way external IP address is determined. This should result in video streams working by default in more setups.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v2.6.0...v2.4.7

## [2.4.6](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v2.4.6) (2020-08-16)

- *Fix:* Fixed bug preventing MQTT/HTTP automation from working.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v2.4.4...v2.4.5

## [2.4.4](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v2.4.4) (2020-08-07)

### What's Changes
- Added support for unbridging specific cameras. This can aid with performance of the camera and Homebridge as a whole, but requires manually adding any unbridged cameras to HomeKit.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v2.4.3...v2.4.4

## [2.4.3](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v2.4.3) (2020-07-29)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/homebridge-plugins/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/releases/tag/v1.0.0) (2020-05-11)

### What's Changes
### Breaking Changes
- homebridge-camera-ffmpeg now comes bundled with it's own pre-built static ffmpeg binaries that are compiled with support for audio (libfdk-aac) and hardware decoding (h264_omx). The following platforms are supported:
  - Raspbian Linux - armv6l (armv7l)
  - Debian/Ubuntu Linux	- x86_64, armv7l, aarch64
  - Alpine Linux - x86_64, armv6l, aarch64
  - macOS (10.14+) - x86_64
  - Windows 10 - x86_64
- If your platform is not supported the plugin will fallback to using your global install of `ffmpeg` automatically.
- Should you wish to force the plugin to use the global install of `ffmpeg` instead of the provided copy, you can simply set `videoProcessor` option to `ffmpeg`. Example:
    ```json
    {
      "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
      "videoProcessor": "ffmpeg",
      "cameras": [
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

### Other Changes
- Initial release.
